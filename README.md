Decided on Java , GUI for table, swing

Sitting at a card table, people at the table, main menu for selecting different games. Black jack, texas hold em, 52 card pickup. 

	- AI different difficulties
		- easy, medium, and spicy based off percentages

Desktop (swing is good  online application, easeir for multiplayer)  vs Mobile (want to avoid JavaFx, android) 

Voice Commands/recognition for poker, maybe easier for mobile, not every computer has a mic

Pitch Idea:
-Pokwer at a table, three different games at different tables as a desktop application
- AI differenet easy, medium, and spicy
- Voice recognition

If it's too easy:
- make it android with multiplyer
